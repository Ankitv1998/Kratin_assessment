Need of Project :
     Health is the only thing that we should care the most. COVID-19 made all the people aware about the importance of health. In such a situation, forgetting about the medicine timings can severely affect the health of an individual. Taking this into consideration, I came up with the idea of this project. The main feature of this project is that it is multi-user. so that all the family members especially the elder people who generally dont have smartphones can get benefitted by saving their schedule in one of the smartphone in their family.

Key Features :
Offline Advantage : As the Application works with an offline database which is stored in the device, no internet connection is required, offline storage of database helps in faster read write operations.
Multiple Users : Medicine timings of multiple users can be stored in the same app in same smartphone.
Medicine Quantity : Quantities of medicine can also be stored so that one can know, how many tablets or medicines he/she has to take.
User Friendly UI : The user interface is made using dynamically updating RecyclerViews, which gets updated as we made changes in database.
